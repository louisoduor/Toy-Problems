## Overview
The Student Grade Generator is a JavaScript program designed to assess and categorize student performance based on input marks. 
This program provides a quick and straightforward way to determine the corresponding grade for a given set of marks.

## Usage

Grade B: Marks between 60 and 79.
Grade C: Marks between 49 and 59.
Grade D: Marks between 40 and 49.
Grade E: Marks less than 40.

// Example: Output grade based on input marks

if (marks >= 80) {
  console.log("A");
} else if (marks >= 60 && marks < 80) {
  console.log("B");
} else if (marks >= 49 && marks < 60) {
  console.log("C");
} else if (marks >= 40 && marks < 49) {
